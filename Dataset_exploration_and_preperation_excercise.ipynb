        "In this excercise we learned how to explore data and quickly create lists and splits and inspect them using core unix commands. If we were training a segmentation system our data is technically ready for training, developing, and evaluting. However, as we start working with the data more, we may discover bugs, or want to tweak how we generated some lists. Therefore, it is wise to write a proper script (e.g. in python) that will produce the same files that we produced using the command line. This is cleaner for running the pipeline for as many times as we need without worrying about accidental error propagation.\n",
